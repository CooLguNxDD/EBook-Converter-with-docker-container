1. Topic idea: what will it actually do?

   -  The project can convert some txt file(or image???) to a readable (epub or other format) ebook.
   -  I may also do some file fomatting such as .doc to .pdf 

2. The three programming languages you will use, and (briefly) what will be implemented with each:

   -  Python, python will be the base system of the program (such as GUI and I/O)
   -  Julia, Julia can provide both concurrent programming and features of functional programming so that the function
      such as text processing may use Julia for the best performance.
   -  C, I am not should about system language yet, maybe I should use it to manage the resources.

3. The two inter-language communication methods you will use.

   - PyJulia, since python is the base program, Pyjulia provide a library to make python access to julia
   - RabbitMQ communicate with a system language and python.

4. Deployment technology: "Docker Compose + Docker".
